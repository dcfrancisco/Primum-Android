Add custom service methods to {@link com.primus.service.impl.PatientServiceImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.

 * This is a remote service. Methods of this service are expected to have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can be accessed remotely.
